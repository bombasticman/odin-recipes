    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tasty and fullfilling also highly variable to suit your taste</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil on a skillet and cook the meat slices on high heat; for about 2 minutes each side (take care not to overcook). Also sauté the sliced tomatoes and peppers at the other side of the skillet, until they start to charcoal at edges.</li>
        <li>Once everything is cooked, plate your Iskender Kebap. Place the warm pide / pita bread slices on each plate. Spread the cooked slices of the meat over the pide bread and pour over the tomato sauce. Place the sautéed tomatoes and peppers at one side and a dollop of plain yoghurt at the other side. Serve immediately. This recipe serves 4 -6 generously.</li>
